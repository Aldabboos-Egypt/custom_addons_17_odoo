About
============
Currently, in odoo all products are visible to the salesperson, sometimes it necessary that salesperson can see their products only. Our module will help to show only specific products to the salesperson. You can assign a salesperson to a particular product so that salesperson only can see the product and its variants in odoo.

============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.

3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
